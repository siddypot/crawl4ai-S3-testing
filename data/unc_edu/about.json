They connect to the future they’re already shaping. Carolina is committed to access for all, providing life-changing opportunities such as the Carolina Covenant, which promises a debt-free education to low-income students.\n  \n  \n\nIn its third century – an era of groundbreaking study and research – UNC-Chapel Hill is harnessing the very best of our fast-changing world. We’re proud to advance knowledge for this and each generation to come.\n## Learn more about Carolina\n  * [ Mission and Values](https://www.unc.edu/about/mission/)\n  * [ History and Traditions](https://www.unc.edu/about/history-and-traditions/)\n  * [ Leadership](https://www.unc.edu/about-the-university/leadership/)\n  * [ By the Numbers](https://www.unc.edu/about-the-university/by-the-numbers/)\n  * [ For the Media](http://uncnews.unc.edu/)\n  * [ Support the University](https://www.unc.edu/about-the-university/support-the-university/)\n  * [ Working at Carolina](https://hr.unc.edu/careers/)\n  * [ Come Visit Us](https://www.unc.edu/visitors/)\n  * [ Branding and Identity Guidelines](https://identity.unc.edu/)\n\n\n  * [![The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill logo](https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/University_Signature_White_Navy_rgb_h.svg)](https://www.unc.edu)\n  *     * [Accessibility](https://www.unc.edu/about/accessibility/)",
