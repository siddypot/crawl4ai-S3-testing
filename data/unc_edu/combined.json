They connect to the future they’re already shaping. Carolina is committed to access for all, providing life-changing opportunities such as the Carolina Covenant, which promises a debt-free education to low-income students.\n  \n  \n\nIn its third century – an era of groundbreaking study and research – UNC-Chapel Hill is harnessing the very best of our fast-changing world.
