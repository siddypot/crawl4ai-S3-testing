#  About the University
The nation’s first public university is at the heart of what’s next, preparing a diverse student body to become creators, explorers, innovators and leaders in North Carolina and throughout the world.
  
  

Carolina’s nationally recognized, innovative teaching, campus-wide spirit of inquiry and dedication to public service continue the legacy that began in 1795 when the University first opened its doors to students.
  
  

In Chapel Hill, students develop a voice for critical thought and the courage to guide change. They connect to the future they’re already shaping. Carolina is committed to access for all, providing life-changing opportunities such as the Carolina Covenant, which promises a debt-free education to low-income students.
  
  

In its third century – an era of groundbreaking study and research – UNC-Chapel Hill is harnessing the very best of our fast-changing world. We’re proud to advance knowledge for this and each generation to come.

## Affordability
Carolina is one of the nation’s few public flagship campuses to practice need-blind admissions and make the promise of a Carolina education possible for all students who earn admission, regardless of their financial means. UNC-Chapel Hill has ranked No. 1 for best value among public institutions according to U.S. News & World Report [for 21 straight years](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2025/09/23/carolina-ranks-as-no-1-best-value-public-for-21st-straight-year/).
The [Carolina Covenant](http://giving.unc.edu/see-your-impact/carolina-covenant/20-years-of-carolina-covenant-stories/), which [just celebrated its 20th anniversary](https://www.unc.edu/story/20-years-of-the-carolina-covenant/), has offered lower-income students who earn admission the opportunity to graduate debt-free. In fall 2024, Carolina began covering out-of-pocket costs for tuition and mandatory fees for [North Carolina undergraduates whose families make less than $80,000 per year](https://studentaid.unc.edu/tuition-commitment/) and have typical assets.

# Leadership
Connecting. Challenging. Championing. For more than two centuries, Carolina’s visionaries have steered the University forward by asking for excellence from its students, faculty and staff – and promising the same in return. Meet the leaders who continue this legacy.
## Board of Trustees
Strong guidance, responsive stewardship and sound decision-making: The Board of Trustees at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the flagship campus of the UNC System, provides all these actions as it works to ensure that the University serves the people of North Carolina. The 15-person board advises the UNC Board of Governors on behalf of Carolina and advises the chancellor on issues of campus management and development, advancing excellence that will benefit Carolina’s students, the state and all the member institutions of the UNC System for years to come.

## Chancellor
Lee H. Roberts was named the 13th chancellor for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Aug. 9, 2024, after serving as interim chancellor. Before that, he was the co-founder and managing partner of SharpVue Capital, a North Carolina investment firm that specializes in stewarding institutional funds and growing local economies.
A dedicated public servant, Roberts was state budget director under Republican Gov. Pat McCrory from 2014 to 2016. He is a strong supporter of higher education, serving as a member of the UNC System Board of Governors and as the chair of its budget committee.
For the last five years, he has taught budgeting at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy. He has also served North Carolina through his positions on the State Board of Community Colleges, North Carolina’s Banking Commission, the Board of Visitors at the Sanford School and the Golden LEAF Foundation.
