## Affordability
Carolina is one of the nation’s few public flagship campuses to practice need-blind admissions and make the promise of a Carolina education possible for all students who earn admission, regardless of their financial means. UNC-Chapel Hill has ranked No. 1 for best value among public institutions according to U.S. News & World Report [for 21 straight years](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2025/09/23/carolina-ranks-as-no-1-best-value-public-for-21st-straight-year/).
The [Carolina Covenant](http://giving.unc.edu/see-your-impact/carolina-covenant/20-years-of-carolina-covenant-stories/), which [just celebrated its 20th anniversary](https://www.unc.edu/story/20-years-of-the-carolina-covenant/), has offered lower-income students who earn admission the opportunity to graduate debt-free. In fall 2024, Carolina began covering out-of-pocket costs for tuition and mandatory fees for [North Carolina undergraduates whose families make less than $80,000 per year](https://studentaid.unc.edu/tuition-commitment/) and have typical assets.

## **Outreach and Service**

Carolina also had nearly 65 advisers of the Carolina College Advising Corps serving 81 high schools to support North Carolinians and help students find colleges where they will thrive.
