_*According to the office of Federal Student Aid, the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college or the amount of federal student aid you will receive. It is a number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive._

SMU assigns a financial aid advisor to all students.
