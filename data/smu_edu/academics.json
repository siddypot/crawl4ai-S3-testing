Our 11:1 student-to-faculty ratio means students build strong relationships with outstanding faculty who champion their ambition and drive, whether it’s for tackling climate change, fighting cancer or pursuing another passion.\n[Explore degrees and programs](https://www.smu.edu/academics/degrees-and-programs)\n## On This Page\n  * [Schools and Colleges](https://www.smu.edu/academics#SchoolsandColleges)\n  * [Research](https://www.smu.edu/academics#Research)\n  * [Libraries](https://www.smu.edu/academics#Libraries)\n  * [Study Abroad](https://www.smu.edu/academics#StudyAbroad)\n  * [Continuing & Professional Education](https://www.smu.edu/academics#ContinuingProfessionalEducation)\n  * [International Student & Scholar Services](https://www.smu.edu/academics#InternationalStudentScholarServices)\n\n\n![A group of students study together in a bright, modern study space with large windows overlooking a scenic campus.

This balance is rare among national institutions, yet fitting for a university like SMU that values balance and breadth in education. With more than 100 majors and 85 minors to choose from, as well as double and triple major opportunities and accelerated degree programs, you can go as far as you want and as quickly, too.\n[ VIEW ALL MAJORS & MINORS ](https://www.smu.edu/academics)\n### Top Links\n  * [Cox School of Business](https://www.smu.edu/cox)\n  * [Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences](https://www.smu.edu/dedman)\n  * [Dedman School of Law](https://www.smu.edu/law)\n  * [Lyle School of Engineering](https://www.smu.edu/lyle)\n  * [Meadows School of the Arts](https://www.smu.edu/meadows)\n  * [Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies](https://www.smu.edu/moody)\n  * [Perkins School of Theology](https://www.smu.edu/perkins)\n  * [Simmons School of Education & Human Development](https://www.smu.edu/simmons)\n  * [The Guildhall](https://www.smu.edu/guildhall)\n\n\n## Research\nSMU’s faculty and students join forces as co-creators of knowledge that spans the arts, sciences, engineering, business and the humanities. Even in their first year, students become hands-on contributors to significant discoveries. In collaboration with industry, nonprofit organizations and other institutions, our researchers forge paths to results that can be applied ethically on a local, national and global scale. SMU researchers shape these discoveries into economic opportunities, stronger communities and a better world.\n[ MORE ABOUT RESEARCH ](https://www.smu.edu/research)\n### Top Links\n  * [Centers & Institutes](https://www.smu.edu/research/centers-and-institutes)",
