Our 11:1 student-to-faculty ratio means students build strong relationships with outstanding faculty who champion their ambition and drive, whether it’s for tackling climate change, fighting cancer or pursuing another passion.\n[Explore degrees and programs](https://www.smu.edu/academics/degrees-and-programs)\n## On This Page\n  * [Schools and Colleges](https://www.smu.edu/academics#SchoolsandColleges)\n  * [Research](https://www.smu.edu/academics#Research)\n  * [Libraries](https://www.smu.edu/academics#Libraries)\n  * [Study Abroad](https://www.smu.edu/academics#StudyAbroad)\n  * [Continuing & Professional Education](https://www.smu.edu/academics#ContinuingProfessionalEducation)\n  * [International Student & Scholar Services](https://www.smu.edu/academics#InternationalStudentScholarServices)\n\n\n![A group of students study together in a bright, modern study space with large windows overlooking a scenic campus.

This balance is rare among national institutions, yet fitting for a university like SMU that values balance and breadth in education. With more than 100 majors and 85 minors to choose from, as well as double and triple major opportunities and accelerated degree programs, you can go as far as you want and as quickly, too.\n[ VIEW ALL MAJORS & MINORS ](https://www.smu.edu/academics)\n### Top Links\n  * [Cox School of Business](https://www.smu.edu/cox)\n  * [Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences](https://www.smu.edu/dedman)\n  * [Dedman School of Law](https://www.smu.edu/law)\n  * [Lyle School of Engineering](https://www.smu.edu/lyle)\n  * [Meadows School of the Arts](https://www.smu.edu/meadows)\n  * [Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies](https://www.smu.edu/moody)\n  * [Perkins School of Theology](https://www.smu.edu/perkins)\n  * [Simmons School of Education & Human Development](https://www.smu.edu/simmons)\n  * [The Guildhall](https://www.smu.edu/guildhall)\n\n\n## Research\nSMU’s faculty and students join forces as co-creators of knowledge that spans the arts, sciences, engineering, business and the humanities. Even in their first year, students become hands-on contributors to significant discoveries. In collaboration with industry, nonprofit organizations and other institutions, our researchers forge paths to results that can be applied ethically on a local, national and global scale. SMU researchers shape these discoveries into economic opportunities, stronger communities and a better world.\n[ MORE ABOUT RESEARCH ](https://www.smu.edu/research)\n### Top Links\n  * [Centers & Institutes](https://www.smu.edu/research/centers-and-institutes)",

R1 is a designation given by the Carnegie Classification of Institution of Higher Education to universities with the highest levels of research activity, spending at least $50 million on research & development and producing at least 70 doctoral graduates annually.\nIn 2025, Carnegie changed the methodology for determining R1 classification. To attain the status, research and development expenditures must total at least $50 million and award 70 doctoral research degrees annually. The threshold to attain R2 classification remained the same — at least $5 million in total research expenditures and awarding at least 20 doctoral research degrees. \nR1 research institutions are now called \"R1: Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production,\" while R2 universities are called \"R2: High Research Spending and Doctorate Production.\" Additionally, Carnegie has a third category for higher education institutions spending at least $2.5 million on research and development called \"Research Colleges and Universities.\"",

      "content": "ate Production.\" Additionally, Carnegie has a third category for higher education institutions spending at least $2.5 million on research and development called \"Research Colleges and Universities.\" \nAchieving Carnegie R1 research institute status places SMU among the nation’s top public and private research universities. Additionally, as a new member of the ACC – one of the nation’s most prestigious academic and athletic conferences – we join the rest of the members who are all R1 institutions. Many universities conduct research at scale, and SMU is well on its way to performing at comparable levels. And many universities aspire to expand beyond research and into the realm of innovation, though fewer can do this successfully.\nUniversities with the R1 Carnegie research classification receive significantly more funding than R2 institutions. Funding comes from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense. \nAttaining R1 status enables SMU to attract more top-tier faculty, invites greater collaboration with other institutions and agencies, increases research opportunities for our students and elevates engagement with community and industry partners — all in the pursuit of research with impact, which is at the heart of our motto to shape World Changers.\nAs Dallas’ only R1 university, SMU partnerships with Dallas-area companies boosts our city’s economy, improves the workforce, and helps address major challenges. We utilize our investments in big data to conduct research at a scale that would have been inconceivable even a decade ago and that responds to the pace and demands of our dynamically changing world.\nSMU means business when it comes to engaging the full research and innovation lifecycle. And there’s no better laboratory than DFW to make this vision a reality. As the SMU research ecosystem grows, we’re focused on areas that are of great interest to our corporate partners. Plus, more than two-thirds of SMU graduates stay in North Texas for their first job. SMU’s R1 status will attract even more world-class research talent to the region.\nUniversity | Type | City  \n---|---|---  \nRice University | Private (non-profit) | Houston  \nSouthern Methodist University (SMU) | Private (non-profit) | Dallas  \nTexas A&M University | Public | College Station  \nTexas Tech University | Public | Lubbock  \nThe University of Texas at Austin | Public | Austin  \nThe University of Texas at Arlington | Public | Arlington  \nThe University of Texas at Dallas | Public | Richardson  \n[Apply Now](https://www.smu.edu/admission/apply)[Visit Us](https://www.smu.edu/admission/campus-visit)\n[Back to top](https://www.smu.edu/research#top)\n## Academics\n  * [Cox School of Business](https://www.smu.edu/cox \"Cox School of Business\")\n  * [Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences](https://www.smu.edu/dedman \"Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences\")\n  * [Dedman School of Law](https://www.smu.edu/law \"Dedman School of Law\")\n  * [Lyle School of Engineering](https://www.smu.edu/lyle \"Lyle School of Engineering\")\n  * [Meadows School of the Arts](https://www.smu.edu/meadows \"Meadows School of the Arts\")\n  * [Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies](https://www.smu.edu/moody \"Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies\")\n  * [Perkins School of Theology](https://www.smu.edu/perkins \"Perkins School of Theology\")\n  * [Simmons School of Education & Human Development](https://www.smu.edu/simmons \"Simmons School of Education & Human Development\")\n  * [SMU CAPE](https://www.smu.edu/cape \"SMU CAPE\")\n  * [SMU Libraries](https://www.smu.edu/libraries \"SMU Libraries\")\n  * [SMU Guildhall](https://www.smu.edu/guildhall \"SMU Guildhall\")\n\n\n## Audience Links\n  * [Undergraduate Students](https://www.smu.edu/infofor/students \"Undergraduate Students\")\n  * [Graduate Students](https://www.smu.edu/moody \"Graduate Students\")\n  * [Alumni](https://www.smu.edu/alumni \"Alumni\")\n  * [Faculty & Staff](https://www.smu.edu/infofor/faculty-staff \"Faculty & Staff\")\n  * [Media](https://www.smu.edu/news \"Media\")\n  * [Parents](https://www.smu.edu/admission/connect-with-us/parents \"Parents\")\n\n\n## Quick Links\n  * [Giving to SMU](https://giving.smu.edu \"Giving to SMU\")\n  * [Corporate and Foundation Relations](https://www.smu.",
