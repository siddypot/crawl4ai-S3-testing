## FAQs
The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classifies universities in terms of their research productivity, with R1 being the pinnacle of distinction among university research rankings. R1 is a designation given by the Carnegie Classification of Institution of Higher Education to universities with the highest levels of research activity, spending at least $50 million on research & development and producing at least 70 doctoral graduates annually.
In 2025, Carnegie changed the methodology for determining R1 classification. To attain the status, research and development expenditures must total at least $50 million and award 70 doctoral research degrees annually. The threshold to attain R2 classification remained the same — at least $5 million in total research expenditures and awarding at least 20 doctoral research degrees. 
R1 research institutions are now called "R1: Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production," while R2 universities are called "R2: High Research Spending and Doctorate Production." Additionally, Carnegie has a third category for higher education institutions spending at least $2.5 million on research and development called "Research Colleges and Universities." 
Achieving Carnegie R1 research institute status places SMU among the nation’s top public and private research universities. Additionally, as a new member of the ACC – one of the nation’s most prestigious academic and athletic conferences – we join the rest of the members who are all R1 institutions. Many universities conduct research at scale, and SMU is well on its way to performing at comparable levels. And many universities aspire to expand beyond research and into the realm of innovation, though fewer can do this successfully.
Universities with the R1 Carnegie research classification receive significantly more funding than R2 institutions. Funding comes from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense. 
Attaining R1 status enables SMU to attract more top-tier faculty, invites greater collaboration with other institutions and agencies, increases research opportunities for our students and elevates engagement with community and industry partners — all in the pursuit of research with impact, which is at the heart of our motto to shape World Changers.
As Dallas’ only R1 university, SMU partnerships with Dallas-area companies boosts our city’s economy, improves the workforce, and helps address major challenges. We utilize our investments in big data to conduct research at a scale that would have been inconceivable even a decade ago and that responds to the pace and demands of our dynamically changing world.
SMU means business when it comes to engaging the full research and innovation lifecycle. And there’s no better laboratory than DFW to make this vision a reality. As the SMU research ecosystem grows, we’re focused on areas that are of great interest to our corporate partners. Plus, more than two-thirds of SMU graduates stay in North Texas for their first job. SMU’s R1 status will attract even more world-class research talent to the region.
